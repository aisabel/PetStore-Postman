  <li>There are two ways to send request: The first one is click on each request and then click button "send". The other one is to click button in the top menu "Runner"</li>
  <li>The first one is click on each request and then click button "send".</li>
  <li>The other one is to click button in the top menu "Runner", select the collection to run and the environment to be used and click button "Start Run". Within this option the number of iterations can be set up manually so the runner will be exceuted "n" times. This option also allows to add delays between each request.</li>
 </ul>
<h3>How to run tests from the command line</h3>
<ul>
  <li>To run the testplan from the command line you need to open a command prompt of Node.js</li>
  <li>Traverse locally until folder where postman test are located</li>
  <li>Run the command: newman run with the following parameters: </il>
    <li>Parameters:
<ol>- Path to the collection name</ol>
<ol>- folder name to run (if applies)</ol>
<ol>- environment to use</ol>
<ol>- the last part is the one where you will store the report formatter (the formatter is located in this repo for your convenience)
finally the last part has the name of the html file where you will find the results of the test.</ol>
</li>
<li>Example:  newman run C:\git\Projects\PetStore.postman_collection.json -e C:\git\Projects\environments\PetStore.postman_environment.json --delay-request 2000 --reporters cli,html --reporter-html-export PostmanResult.html</li>
